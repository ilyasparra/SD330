        <p>Enforcement of parking policies will commence on the first day of classes. Each member of the Marist
            community should park in the lot(s) where your permit is assigned. There are signs at each parking lot
            entrance for your reference. Fines vary from $30 to $100 per violation, and repeat offenders will be booted.
            This includes the failure to display a parking decal.</p>

            <p>The portal to apply for a parking pass/decal for the 2023-2024 academic year will remain open into the
                fall semester. Students are encouraged to register during specified dates during the summer, to allow
                for the permits to be mailed to a home address. The portal can be found by accessing your myMarist
                account and clicking on “Parking Registration” under the Quick Links on the left. All students,
                including Commuter students, are required to obtain and display a parking permit to park a car on
                campus.</p>
